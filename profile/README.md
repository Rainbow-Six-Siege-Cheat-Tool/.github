## What Are Rainbow Six Siege Cheats?

R6 cheats are third-party programs or injectors that give players extra abilities not found in the vanilla game. They‚Äôre designed to remove the element of surprise and make gunfights much easier, allowing cheaters to track enemies, snap to heads, and survive encounters that would normally end in defeat.

Unlike **Fall Guys hacks** that focus on movement and trolling, Rainbow Six Siege cheats are all about precision and tactics. They‚Äôre closer to **CS2 aimbots** or **Valorant wallhacks**, but often more advanced since Siege has destructible environments and gadgets.
